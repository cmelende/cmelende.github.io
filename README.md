## What is Project Sydney?
Project Sydney is a personal assistant I’m building to help with lightweight scheduling and communications. It can:
- Send SMS reminders and confirmations
- Coordinate phone call times
- Provide brief updates that I’ve requested it to share

All messaging is low volume and targeted to people who have agreed to be contacted.

## How I Obtain Consent (Opt-In)
I only message people who have **explicitly agreed** to receive texts/calls from me.

**Opt-in flows I use:**
- **Direct consent:** You provide your phone number to me (verbally or in writing) and agree to receive messages/calls from “Cory’s Assistant (Project Sydney).”
- **Double opt-in (when applicable):** The first message asks you to reply **YES** to confirm before additional messages are sent.

**Example opt-in message:**  
“ You’ve requested to receive messages from Cory’s Assistant (Project Sydney). Reply **YES** to confirm. Reply **STOP** to unsubscribe at any time. ”

## How to Opt Out (Unsubscribe)
You can opt out **any time** by doing either of the following:

- **Reply `STOP`** to any message (immediately ends messaging to your number), or  
- **Email me at** [cory.melendez@outlook.com](mailto:cory.melendez@outlook.com) requesting removal.

You may also reply `START` to re-subscribe after opting out, and `HELP` for basic assistance.

## Sample Messages
- “Hello [Name], this is Cory’s Assistant. You asked me to confirm your appointment at [Time]. Reply **YES** to confirm. Reply **STOP** to unsubscribe.”
- “Hi [Name], this is Cory’s Assistant. Are you available for a call at [Time] to discuss [Subject]? Reply **YES** if this works. Reply **STOP** to unsubscribe.”

## Frequency, Charges & Carriers
- **Message frequency:** Low and event-driven (e.g., confirmations, reminders you requested).
- **Message & data rates may apply.**
- Delivery may depend on your mobile carrier/network status. Carriers are **not liable** for delayed or undelivered messages.

---

## Privacy & Data Use
- I only use your phone number to send assistant-related communications you’ve agreed to receive.
- I do **not** sell or share your number with third parties.
- On request, I will delete your number and any related message history tied to it.

If you have any questions about how your data is used, contact me at
[cory.melendez@outlook.com](mailto:cory.melendez@outlook.com).
